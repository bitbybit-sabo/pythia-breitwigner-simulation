1. This is a very simple recreation of the Resonant Mass Spectra of Z and W Bosons with restricted decay channels. (decay products are only fermionic leptons excluding tau and it's anti particle)
2. To incorporate detector physics realism, I have used PYTHIA8 to generate particles and simulate their interactions.
3. Resulting plots (including the plots with relativistic breit-wigner fitted curves) have been also attached.
4. Extending the project beyond the fermionic lepton channels and incorporating more realistic detector smearing effects is the current aim :)
